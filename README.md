A simple but powerful tool for Windows users to prevent OLED burn-in and create a distraction-free workspace by automatically blacking out or dimming idle monitors.

## The Problem

OLED displays are susceptible to permanent image retention (burn-in) from static images. Additionally, many power users want to turn off secondary monitors for focus or gaming without putting the entire computer to sleep. Standard Windows power settings can't do this; it's all or nothing.

---

## The Solution

OLED Sleeper runs quietly in the background, checking for activity (mouse movement or active window presence) on each screen. If a designated monitor remains idle for a user-defined period, the script will either overlay it with a pure black screen or reduce its brightness â€” depending on your chosen mode.

This is useful not only for **protecting OLEDs**, but also for creating a more focused environment on any multi-monitor setup.

---

## How It Works

The script checks for:

- **Mouse movement** over each monitor
- **Active window focus** on that monitor

If neither is detected for a set time, the monitor is considered idle. No other input is monitored.

---

## Features

* **Per-Monitor Control:** Choose exactly which monitors to manage.
* **Adjustable Idle Timer:** Set any idle duration you want.
* **Two Idle Modes:** Choose between full **blackout** or brightness **dimming** for each monitor.
* **Automatic Startup:** Configure once and the script will automatically run every time you log in to Windows.
* **Resilient State Saving:** Remembers which monitors were dimmed or blacked out, even if your PC shuts down unexpectedly.
* **Instant Wake-Up:** Overlays are removed and brightness is restored the moment activity is detected.
* **Lightweight:** Uses minimal memory and CPU.
* **Simple Setup:** A command-line wizard guides you through initial setup, re-configuration, and removal.

---

## Requirements

* **Operating System:** Windows 10 or 11
* **Dependency:** [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) must be installed
* **DDC/CI Support (for Dimming Mode):** Dimming requires a monitor that supports DDC/CI brightness control via VCP codes. Most modern OLED monitors support this, but it is not guaranteed on all displays.

## How to Use

1.  Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Quorthon13/OLED-Sleeper/releases) or clone this repository.
2.  Unzip the folder to a permanent location on your computer (e.g., `C:\Program Files\OLED-Sleeper`).
3.  Double-click **`Configure.ps1`**.
4.  A menu will appear:
    * **To set up for the first time or to change your settings**, choose option `1`. The wizard will guide you through selecting monitors, modes, and an idle time. When prompted, allow it to create the startup task.
    * **To remove the startup task and settings**, choose option `2`. This will delete the automatic startup shortcut and all saved configurations. Note that this action does not stop any scripts that are currently running.

That's it. Once configured, the scripts will run silently in the background and launch automatically every time you log in.
